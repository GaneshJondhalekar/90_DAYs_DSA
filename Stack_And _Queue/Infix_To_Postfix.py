'''Infix expressions are readable and solvable by humans. We can easily distinguish the order of operators, 
and also can use the parenthesis to solve that part first during solving mathematical expressions. 
The computer cannot differentiate the operators and parenthesis easily, thatâ€™s why postfix/prefix conversion is needed.
Compilers or command editor in computer and some calculators also convert expression to prefix/postfix first and 
then solve those expression to evaluate answer for the same.
