Applications of linked list in the real world:

1. Image viewer – Previous and next images are linked and can be accessed by the next and previous buttons.

2. Previous and next page in a web browser – We can access the previous and 
   next URL searched in a web browser by pressing the back and next buttons since they are linked as a linked list.

3. Music Player – Songs in the music player are linked to the previous and next songs. 
   So you can play songs either from starting or ending of the list.

4. Task scheduling - In real-time systems, linked lists can be utilized for task scheduling, 
   where processes or tasks are prioritized and executed based on their priority levels. 
   The linked list allows for easy insertion, deletion, and rearrangement of tasks based on their priority.
